5. Example of simple application

An example of a simple application comprises just one component and one client appication. As an example, we develop a component summing up two integer numbers. The file with a description of an interface (isum.h):

--- code ---

The same id is used by defining a class-implementation and by instantiating a class in the class factory, so we can put in in a separate file (class_ids.h):

--- code ---

Further, we write an implementation for a certain interface with the predefined id (calc_service.h)

--- code ---

The implementation of the (calc_service.cpp):

-- code ---

After creating a component the module's entry point must be defined (module.cpp):

-- code ---

Afterwards we compile our source code and link it up as a shared library. The produced library is registered in the service registry:


---- command---

On the Windows platform the name of a service is calc_service.dll.

Below you can see the code of the main application:

--- code ---

After compiling the application is ready for work.
